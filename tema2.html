  <h2>Wait, what?</h2>
  <p>Wait a minute. I said I wanted simple, but not boring, What is up with this design? There's nothing on it but white space and some text and a minimal picture. That's not what I had in mind. The type is all in Helvetica, Which I like, but i doesn't excite me at all. There is just no character to anything here. It has a minimal look, but it's just too vanilla. I really need something to grab the attention of a visitor to the sie and this just doesn't do it.</p>
